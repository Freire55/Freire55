# Personal Projects

## Mobile Applications

| Project | Description |Repository |
|--------|-------------------------|
| **Bet Tracking App** | Mobile application for tracking and analyzing sports and casino betting activity, focused on balance control and performance analysis. | [View Repo](https://github.com/Freire55/Bet_Tracking_App) |

## Project Integration

These two applications are designed to work together on the same device for **comprehensive financial management**.  
The **Balance App can import betting transactions** from the Bet Tracking App, providing a unified financial overview.

> ⚠️ Currently uses local SQLite databases with data export/import functionality.  
> 🚀 **Planned Enhancement**: Cloud database integration (Supabase/Firebase) for real-time synchronization across both apps.

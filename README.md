## 🔗 Project Integration

These two applications are designed to operate **on the same device**, sharing a **local SQLite database**.  
The **Balance App automatically reflects betting transactions** recorded in the Bet Tracking App, providing a unified financial overview.

> ⚠️ No backend or cloud synchronization is currently implemented. All data is stored locally on the device.
